  <!-- ARTIST STATEMENT -->
  <section class="statement">
    <p>The human form; malleable, resistant, powerful in the most mysterious ways. I sometimes wonder how much emotional turmoil and trauma changes the physical make up of your build.</p>

    <p>In this project I will explore my own wounds through my body, further deepening my relationship to myself. As someone who tends to shy away from sharing herself, I want to push myself to complete and total transparency, as on the other side of that is the very artist and human I long to be.</p>

    <p>I want to gain a deeper love and recognition of self. The way the body houses and holds the most eventful and possibly traumatic experiences is miraculous, it’s a warehouse. It's a hub, it’s a repository of the human condition.</p>

    <p>Those experiences and events lay the foundation for what and who we become; the body keeps the score.</p>

    <p>As a thicker, taller, dark skinned Black woman in this country, my relationship to beauty recognition has been at times a daunting task. Searching the recesses of my mind, I struggle to find moments of contentment in regards to my body, to my shape, to this temple that houses the most powerful light.</p>

    <p>In this project, I explore the overlapping intersection of emotional trauma—where it’s stored, and how it changes, shifts, and morphs the body.</p>

    <p>Collage allows me to chop, paste, oversize, replace, and rebuild. To take an image and create an entirely new world. Using images to tell truths that words alone cannot hold.</p>

    <p>Where do those words live in your body? How do they affect the way you walk through the world? Where do you carry your trauma?</p>

    <p>This is an undressing of myself to the world. I see butterfly wings, flowers, tentacles, an ocean—layers upon layers I want to unearth to reach my core.</p>

    <p>I don’t know what my core is yet, but I am excited to invite the audience on that journey with me.</p>

    <p>Reclaiming my body in this world means having the ability to take up space in it.</p>
