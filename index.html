  <!-- ARTIST STATEMENT -->
  <main class="statement">
    <p>The human form; malleable, resistant, powerful in the most mysterious ways. I sometimes wonder how much emotional turmoil and trauma changes the physical make up of your build.</p>

    In this project I will explore my own wounds through my body, further deepening my relationship to myself. As someone who tends to shy away from sharing herself, I want to push myself to complete and total transparency, as on the other side of that is the very artist and human I long to be.</p>

    I want to gain a deeper love and recognition of self. The way the body houses and holds the most eventful and possibly traumatic experiences is miraculous, it’s a warehouse. It's a hub, it’s a repository of the human condition.

    Those experiences and events lay the foundation for what and who we become; the body keeps the score.

    The intimacy in the relationship one has to their body is profound, even if seen in a negative light. As a thicker, taller, dark skinned Black woman in this country, my relationship to beauty recognition has been at times a daunting task.</p>

    Being bigger in shape has always been a point of contention for me. Searching the recesses of my mind, I struggle to find moments of contentment in regards to my body, to my shape, to this temple that houses the most powerful light.

    I believe to some extent or another every living being has or continues to struggle with loving, accepting, and cherishing their bodies.

    In this project, I will be exploring the overlapping intersection of emotional trauma—where it’s stored, and how it changes, shifts, and morphs the body.

    <p>Through this, I hope to gain a greater love, appreciation, and understanding of myself, and of what my body has gone through.</p>

    <p>Collage became my language. The chopping, the pasting, the oversizing, the replacing. Taking images and creating entire worlds—using visuals to tell truths words alone cannot hold.</p>

   Where do those words live in your body? How do they affect the way you walk through the world? Where do you carry that trauma?</p>

  I want to reclaim my vision and my version of myself. This is the undressing of myself to the world.

  I see butterfly wings, flowers, tentacles, an ocean—layers upon layers I want to unearth to reach my core.

    I don’t know what my core is yet, but I am excited to invite the audience on that journey with me.

    <p>Reclaiming my body in this world means having the ability to take up space in it.</p>
